# Server Side Calculator

## Description

When I first started working on the project I though I had understood everything needed to a good level, once I started getting really into it I found out that wasn't true at all. I found that I didn't quite fully understand the relationship between server and client that well, but once I figured that out things started to pick up speed. Once I understood that each http method all pretty much do same thing with just slight difference in how they achieve their end goal. I also had trouble getting the data from the POST, and sending that to client. I had my question answered when my instructor did the livesolve. From what I understand POST gives everything back in objects, so the data will come back in an object. I had that part down all I needed was to put data into an object I created and push that an array. Then refrence those keys in the client.
